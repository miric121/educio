Education Management Platform for Teachers

High school teachers often find themselves bogged down by the immense amount of information they need to keep track of for each class they teach. Sometimes class agendas are misplaced, important task items are forgotten, or attendance is forgotten.

This is where Educio comes into play, by helping teachers aggregate their resources in one place to better manage class materials.
